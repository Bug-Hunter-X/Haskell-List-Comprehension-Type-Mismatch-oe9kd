The solution involves ensuring that the expression within the list comprehension consistently returns the expected type. This often requires explicitly specifying types or using type-safe functions and data structures. One possible solution is to use a more specific type signature or to use a function that explicitly maps to a specific type.  Another approach is to use a different list processing technique, such as `map`, which helps maintain type safety more explicitly. In the given example, explicitly adding a type annotation would not solve the problem because the error occurs within the expression and not the function that creates the list. Instead, using the `map` function would provide a much cleaner and safer way to generate the list of squares.
